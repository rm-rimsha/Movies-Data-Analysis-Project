# Movies-Data-Analysis-Project

**Introduction:**
  For this data analysis project, I utilized the TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset, covering the years 1950 to 2016. To focus the analysis, the dataset was refined to include data from 2010 to 2016.   This data was derived from Kaggle.

**Data Cleaning:**
  The primary tasks undertaken included:
  **Filtering by Year:** To ensure relevance to contemporary cinema, limited the dataset to movies released from 2010 to 2016.
  **Handling Missing Data:** Removed rows with missing or null values, ensuring the dataset was reliable for analysis.
  **Genre Extraction:** The dataset contained genre information in JSON format. Extracted and transformed this data into a genre list, enabling efficient genre-based analysis.
  **Seasonal Categorization:** Introduced a new column to categorize movies by season, providing a fresh dimension for seasonal analysis.

**Data Analysis:**
  **Yearly Budget and Revenue Trends**
    Annual trends were closely monitored by analyzing budgets and revenues. The financial contribution of each genre was found by the percentage breakdown.
    **Genre Profitability**
    Calculated the revenue-budget ratio of each genre to find the profitability of each genre.
    **Genre Popularity**
    The popularity of each genre was found to analyze the data for a customer-oriented analysis.
    **Revenue Across Movie Runtimes**
    Movies were categorized into runtime ranges (e.g., short, average, long) to evaluate revenues within these segments.
    **Seasonal Revenue Analysis**
    This analysis pinpointed the periods when the highest revenue is typically realized.

**Data Visualization:**
  Visualized the analyzed data and created a dashboard on Tableau
